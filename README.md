## Description

The project aims to build a starting 11 lineup within a limited budget using player data from FIFA 23. The player prices and current teams are sourced from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), with prices accurate as of June 10, 2023, marking the end of the 2022/2023 European league season.

## Workflow

1. Start the web page and select your budget for building the ideal 11 lineup. For example, choose a budget of 200 million euros.

2. After clicking the "Select my starting 11" button, a filter menu will appear, displaying only the players that fit within your remaining budget.

   - Filter players by League (All Leagues available, Only Top 5 leagues or Not in the top 5 leagues), Club, Continent, Nationality, Overall, Potential, Age, and Market Value. You can also sort the results by Overall, Potential, Age, Market Value, and FIFA stats like Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical, Diving, Handling, Kicking, Reflexes, Speed, and Positioning.

3. For example, if you are looking for a goalkeeper (GK) with specific filters, you can select them as shown below:

   The filtered results will be displayed:

4. Each player's FIFA card will provide you with their stats, potential, age, club, nationality, and name. Navigate through the players using the previous and next buttons, which show the next or previous five players.

5. When you make a decision, click on "Add to my team" to create a table showing the remaining budget and the selected players. You can remove a player if desired, and the money will be returned to the budget.

6. After selecting all 11 players (with a remaining budget of â‚¬1,000,000 in this example), the lineup will look as follows:
